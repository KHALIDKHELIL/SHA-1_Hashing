#SHA-1 Hash Calculator

##Description

This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that calculates the SHA-1 hash for a given input string. The application is built using Java and Swing for the GUI components. It provides functionalities to compute, copy, and clear the SHA-1 hash, as well as a dark mode toggle for better user experience.

##Features

- **Input field**: Allows users to input the string they want to hash.
- **Hash button**: Computes the SHA-1 hash of the input string.
- **Copy button**: Copies the computed SHA-1 hash to the clipboard.
- **Clear button**: Clears both the input field and the result area.
- **Exit button**: Closes the application.
- **How It Works button**: Displays a dialog explaining how the SHA-1 algorithm works and how to use the application.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggles between light and dark modes for the GUI.
